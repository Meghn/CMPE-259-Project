# CMPE-259-Project
A Symptom based Home Remedy Virtual Assistant

Many common symptoms can be managed at home with gentle, natural remedies, avoiding potential side effects of pharmaceutical medicines. In the U.S., long wait times for doctor appointments make quick, accessible remedies essential. Avva aims to provide users with home-based solutions, promoting health through food and natural means as a non-medical alternative for minor ailments.  

Traditional healing knowledge, passed down through generations—especially by grandmothers—includes practical, effective kitchen hacks for everyday ailments. Though not always scientifically studied, these remedies have been validated through lived experience. This project is a tribute to such wisdom, particularly to my great-grandmother(whom I call Avva), who was renowned in her village for assisting childbirth and crafting postpartum care solutions using everyday items. By developing Avva, I seek to preserve and digitize this knowledge, offering users comfort and immediate guidance, just like calling a mother or grandmother for advice.
